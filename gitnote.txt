git and github are different things

git is version control, github is a way to host code and is useful for developing projects

a repository is like a folder on github 
    can be public or private, visibility

we clone a repository so we can work on it locally,
then we reflect these changes via first committing a change
then pushing it which sends the local commit to the remote repository

things can be pushed to certain branches
    branches are a useful tool, and you can merge these branches 
    via a pull request or proposing the changes held within the branch

    branches can be compared by the person approving the pull request
