doctype declaration tells browser it is using HTML

Element describes something within HTML
tag describes a <> instance
content describes something within the tag

tags can have attributes that tells something about the tag 

divs and spans differ in a sense that spans are continuous while div often line breaks

semantic HTML is a more descriptive way of what we've been doing
	so instead of divs we're using stff like <nav> or <article> or <footer>
	some examples:
		header
		nav
		section
		article
		aside
		footer
